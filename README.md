## Content/Gameplay ##
Yohane is a character all about trade offs and big numbers. Many cards are powerful, but have some sort of negative effect to them requiring well thought out plays, highly rewarding plays. 

### Compatibility ###
There shouldn't be any issues with other mods.

A resource that many attacks give. Used to play 0 cost cards.
* **Secrets**
These cards will retain in your hand and have positive and negative effects. They are discarded upon use.
